    "- **Part 3** introduces PyTorch data pipelines: `Dataset`, `DataLoader`, transforms, data augmentation, and train/validation splitting using the Horses-or-Humans dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Understanding\n",
    "1. Explain why CNNs are better suited for image data than fully-connected networks (spatial structure, weight sharing, local receptive fields).\n",
    "2. Describe the role of each CNN building block — convolution, pooling, flatten, dense, dropout, and global average pooling.\n",
    "3. Explain how a trained CNN can serve as a feature extractor for classical ML models.\n",
    "4. Articulate why transfer learning works: what general features pretrained models learn and how they transfer to new tasks.\n",
    "5. Distinguish between preprocessing transforms (deterministic, applied everywhere) and augmentation transforms (stochastic, training only).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Skills (PyTorch)\n",
    "6. Build a CNN architecture from scratch using `nn.Module` and calculate feature map dimensions through the network.\n",
    "7. Train and evaluate binary classifiers using `BCEWithLogitsLoss` with early stopping.\n",
    "8. Use `torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder` to load image datasets organized by class directories.\n",
    "9. Construct PyTorch data pipelines with `Dataset`, `DataLoader`, and `transforms.Compose`.\n",
    "10. Apply data augmentation (flips, rotations, color jitter) to training data using torchvision transforms.\n",
    "11. Perform transfer learning: load a pretrained model, freeze the backbone, and train a new classifier head."

PyTorch provides a flexible data loading system for exactly this purpose, built around two key classes:\n",
